Student Management Portal (Backend API)
Welcome to the backend API repository for the University Student Management Portal project.
This project is a RESTful API built using Spring Boot, designed to manage student records and course enrollments. It uses a decoupled architecture, intended to be consumed by a separate frontend application (e.g., a Next.js client).
Technologies Used
Java 25
Spring Boot 3.5.7
Maven (for dependency management)
H2 Database (for local development/testing)
JPA / Hibernate (for data persistence)
Lombok (optional, if you add it later for getter/setter generation)
Getting Started (Local Development)
These instructions will get a copy of the project running on your local machine.
Prerequisites
JDK 25 or higher installed.
Maven installed.
Installation and Run
Clone the repository:
bash
git clone github.com
cd lms
Use code with caution.

Build the project:
bash
mvn clean install
Use code with caution.

Run the application:
bash
mvn spring-boot:run
Use code with caution.

The API will be running at http://localhost:8080.
API Endpoints
The following endpoints are available:
Method
Endpoint
Description
GET	/students	Retrieve a list of all students.
GET	/students/{id}	Retrieve a specific student by ID.
POST	/students	Create a new student (requires JSON body).
PUT	/students/{id}	Update an existing student by ID.

Development Tools
In-Memory Database (H2)
This project uses an in-memory H2 database for development. The schema is automatically generated by Hibernate, and seed data is populated on startup using the DataSeeder class.
You can access the H2 console to inspect the database schema and data while the application is running:
URL: http://localhost:8080/h2-console
JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:studentdb
Username: sa
Password: (blank)
API Testing
We recommend using the Thunder Client or Postman VS Code extensions to test the endpoints listed above.
Error Handling
The application uses a @ControllerAdvice (GlobalExceptionHandler) to provide consistent error responses. Validation errors return a 400 Bad Request with detailed field-specific messages in the JSON body, and RuntimeExceptions (like "Student not found") return a 404 Not Found.
